<h2>Why should I get Dash Quest?</h2>
<p class="contentpara">
Dash Quest is an endless runner/rpg from Tiny Titan Studios. It’s heavily retro inspired with it’s old school graphics and effects but has modern game design. <br><br>The important stuff: this is a free, ad-supported game. The ads are few and far between, and they can be turned off with an IAP (in-app purchase) for $2.99, super reasonable. There are other IAPs, all really well priced. I’d suggest getting the Double XP boost. It’s permanent, just $4.99, and will be a really big help to you as you continue playing, as you’ll read below – you’ll definitely wish you’d bought it early once you sink all your time into this game!</p>
